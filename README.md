###Jason Walter and Joe Spencer 2019 CHC Cyber Security Project###

This is the broker server for the CHC snowday botnet. Its functionality
is simple - to distribute ping-time data to all bots across the network
and as such allow for the most efficient pinging of the CHC website.
Auxiliary to this, the server will also distribute message data across
the network such that all bots know when to stop pinging, as well as
publish scraped messages to Discord.
