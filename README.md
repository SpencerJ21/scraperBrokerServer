## About
This is the GitHub repository for the Calvert Hall Snow Day Botnet. The network checks for snow days and pushes a message to the Calvert Hall Discord when one is announced. Included within are the server, which functions as a broker for ping-scheduling, and the client, which pings the Calvert Hall website to check for a snow day. The project is written in Javascript, and executed natively with Node.js.

## Security
The botnet uses TLS encryption to secure traffic, and client verification as well as protection against snow day spoofing are both in development.

## Licensing
*Do whatever you want with the code, it sucks anyway.*
*Just make sure to shout us out or whatever.*
